# Task 3: Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

## Objective
To implement and understand both simple and multiple linear regression using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset
Housing dataset from Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset (including encoding categorical variables).
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Fitted both simple and multiple linear regression models using `sklearn.linear_model`.
4. Evaluated the models using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - RÂ² Score
5. Plotted regression lines and interpreted model coefficients.
